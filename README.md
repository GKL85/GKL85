- 👋 Hi, I’m @GKL85
- 👀 I’m interested in football, programming, music, mathematics, puzzle-solving, sports, and reading.
- 🌱 I’m currently  I’m currently learning new programming languages, exploring different musical genres, and writing a book.
-      I'm also working on creating an NGO based on AI to help lift my country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, out of poverty.
-      This NGO also fights against corruption, bad governance, and the exploitation of indigenous populations,
-      as well as aims to provide clean drinking water for all.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative software projects, interesting puzzle challenges, and initiatives aimed at reducing
-      poverty through AI. I would like to work with major international organizations to implement a solution that involves local
-      populations and focuses on innovation and instruction in development methods rather than financial means.
